        The settings in the SLA bean define how will the Processing Unit be deployed
		onto the Service Grid (These settings can be overriden when using the deployment wizard UI).
        
        For step three of the tutorial - deploying 1 instance, set:
        number-of-instances="1"
    	number-of-backups="0"   (Number of backups per instance)
    	
        For step three of the tutorial - deploying 1 instance with 1 backup, set:
        number-of-instances="1"
    	number-of-backups="1"
        
        For step four of the tutorial - deploying a partition of 3 instances, set:
        number-of-instances="3"
    	number-of-backups="0"
    	
        For step four of the tutorial - deploying a partition of 2 instances each with 1 backup (toatl 4 instances), set:
        number-of-instances="2"
    	number-of-backups="1"
        
        Setting maxInstancesPerVM = 1, mandates that an active instance and ITS backup won't run inside the same Grid Container
